## ðŸ“Œ Regression Models for Machine Learning  

This branch contains implementations of **regression algorithms** used in **machine learning**. The focus is on different regression techniques, including:  

- **Linear Regression**  
- **Polynomial Regression**  
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**  
- **Decision Tree Regression**  
- **Random Forest Regression**  

Each implementation includes **explanations, code, and sample datasets** to help understand how regression works.  

ðŸ”¹ **Goal:** Predict continuous values and analyze relationships between variables.  
ðŸ”¹ **Usage:** Modify and run the scripts to experiment with different regression models.  

ðŸš€ **Happy Learning!**
