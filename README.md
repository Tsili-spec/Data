# Regression Evaluation with R-Squared (R²)

## Overview
This repository provides a simple implementation of regression evaluation using R-squared (R²) as the primary metric. R² measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

## Interpretation of R²
- **R² = 1**: Perfect fit; all variance is explained(Suspicious).
- **R² > 0.7**: Good model.
- **0.5 < R² ≤ 0.7**: Moderate performance.
- **R² < 0.5**: Weak model; consider improving features or model tuning.
